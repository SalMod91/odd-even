                    <h2>Rules!</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to the Odd or Even game!</p>
                    <p>The objective of the game is to correctly guess whether the total number of marbles is odd or
                        even.</p>
                    <p>Here's how the game works:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Both you and your opponent start with 10 marbles each.</li>
                        <li>On each turn, the guesser will wager a number of marbles and the hider hides an amount of
                            marbles.</li>
                        <li>The guesser has to guess if the total number of marbles that the hider is hiding is odd or
                            even.</li>
                        <li>For balance sake both the player and the computer can only wager or hide a maximum of 4
                            marbles.</li>
                        <li>If the guesser guesses correctly, the hider gives the amount of marbles wagered to the
                            guesser.</li>
                        <li>If the guesser guesses incorrectly, the guesser gives the amount of marbles wagered to the
                            hider.</li>
                        <li>The game continues until the player has lost or won all the marbles.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If the rules aren't clear you can always check out the role button in the top left corner.</p>

                        <li>You declare if you think that the total marbles the computer is hiding is odd or even.</li>

                        <li>After you declared your decisions the computer has to show his hand.</li>
                        <li>If you guessed odd or even correctly you win the amount you wagered and take it from your
                            opponent's marbles.</li>
                        <li>If you guessed odd or even incorrectly you give the amount of marbles wagered to your
                            opponent.</li>
                        <li>Afterwards the roles switch.</li>
