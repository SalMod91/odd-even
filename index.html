                <p>Welcome to the Odd or Even game!</p>
                <p>The objective of the game is to correctly guess whether the total number of marbles is odd or even.</p>
                <p>Here's how the game works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Both you and your opponent start with 10 marbles each.</li>
                    <li>On each turn, the guesser will wager a number of marbles and the hider hides an amount of marbles.</li>
                    <li>The guesser has to guess if the total number of marbles that the hider is hiding is odd or even.</li>
                    <li>For balance sake both the player and the computer can only wager or hide a maximum of 4 marbles.</li>
                    <li>If the guesser guesses correctly, the hider gives the amount of marbles wagered to the guesser.</li>
                    <li>If the guesser guesses incorrectly, the guesser gives the amount of marbles wagered to the hider.</li>
                    <li>The game continues until the player has lost or won all the marbles.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the rules aren't clear you can always check out the role button in the top left corner.</p>

                <p>Your role this turn is the guesser.</p>
                <p>This is how the Guesser's turn works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You declare if you think that the total marbles the computer is hiding is odd or even.</li>
                    <li>You declare how many marbles you want to wager up to a maximum of 4 marbles.</li>
                    <li>After you declared your decisions the computer has to show his hand.</li>
                    <li>If you guessed odd or even correctly you win the amount you wagered and take it from your opponent's marbles.</li>
                    <li>If you guessed odd or even incorrectly you give the amount of marbles wagered to your opponent.</li>
                    <li>Afterwards the roles switch.</li>
                    <li>The game continues until you have lost or won all 20 total marbles.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By pressing the QUIT button you close the game and reset the score.</p>
                <p>By pressing the CLOSE button you close this window.</p>

                <p>Your role this turn is the hider.</p>
                <p>This is how the Hider's turn works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You hide a certain amount of marbles and your opponent declares if the total marbles is either odd or even.</li>
                    <li>If your opponent guessed odd or even correctly your opponent takes an amount of marbles from you based on your opponent's wager.</li>
                    <li>If your opponent guessed odd or even incorrectly you take an amount of marbles from your opponent based on your opponent's wager.</li>
                    <li>Afterwards the roles switch.</li>
                    <li>The game continues until you have lost or won all 20 total marbles.</li>
